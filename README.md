# Power Wheelchair Guide
This App aims to inform and encourage consumers and their families to play an active role in acquiring, using, and maintaining their wheelchairs and handling health issues related to wheelchair use. Included in this app, with minor modifications, are the following: the Wheelchair Skills Programs developed at Dalhousie University, the Wheelchair Maintenance Training Program developed through the Collaboration on Mobility Training (NIDILRR grant #90DP0025), and the Mobility Map developed at United Spinal Association contributed informative educational materials for wheelchair users. The App is co-developed by the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Technology at the University of Pittsburgh and United Spinal Association under the support of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (Grant # 90DP0056).
